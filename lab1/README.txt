2/20/20 Started lab
created new directory to hold lab1 in the comp322 repository

used fork to make a clone of the program as a child
split main into parent and child section using if statements

2/27/20 finishing up lab
since the process is too fast to see a time change I made the program sleep for 3 seconds

moved the print statements from main into a separate print method that can be used by the parent and the child

cleaned up the code a little bit and finalized things

commented on everything and made last commit
