5/13/20 

Made the makefile for the project.

Started on the matrix generator and finished it. Just prints random numbers from

-100 to 100 in the shape of a matrix.

5/14/20

Started on matrix add, havent got much done so

5/16/20-5/19/20

Been stuck on an issue where I was not able to read all the rows of the matrix from the input.

Figured out I was calculating the total size incorrectly and also moved the forloop around to accomodate for

the last row.

Have made no progress on matrix add function but still working on it.

Done for the night, hopefully not much left to finish before grading is done.
