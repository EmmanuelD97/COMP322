# COMP322
I started my first edit, trying to submit.

figured out how to read from input file and display the ascii input.
created method to find parity.

figured out how to pad the ascii input if it has less than 8 characters

implemented a counter to print a line which includes the ascii input, ascii character, decimal and parity every 8 characters

added a new method to just print each new line of ascii, character, decimal, parity output by passing an array to it

implemented read(), and a function to account for every possible valid input

took care of some minor bugs regarding a stack overflow

turned some of the repetetive code into a function

commented on the code to make it more readable

changed somethings to make the code meet the grading criteria like adding the read() and letting the program terminate naturally

lab0 is complete I made final changes to clean up the code.
