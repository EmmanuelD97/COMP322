# COMP322
I started my first edit, trying to submit.

figured out how to read from input file and display the ascii input.
created method to find parity.

figured out how to pad the ascii input if it has less than 8 characters

implemented a counter to print a line which includes the ascii input, ascii character, decimal and parity every 8 characters

added a new method to just print each new line of ascii, character, decimal, parity output by passing an array to it

implemented read(), and a method to read from the command line if there is no input file given

took care of every possible valid input

took care of some minor bugs that gave issues with printing
